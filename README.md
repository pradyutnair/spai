**SPAI employs spectral learning to learn the spectral distribution of real 
images under a self-supervised setup. Then, using the spectral 
reconstruction similarity it detects AI-generated images as out-of-distribution 
samples of this learned model.**

### :newspaper: News

- 28/03/25: Code released.
- 27/02/25: Paper accepted on CVPR2025.

## :hammer: Installation

### Hardware requirements

The code originally targeted Nvidia L40S 48GB GPU, however many recent cuda-enabled GPUs should be
supported. Inference should be effortless performed with less than 8GB of GPU RAM. As training originally
targeted a 48GB GPU, a suitable GPU should be presented to reproduce the paper's setup
without further modifications of the code. 

### Required libraries
To train and evaluate SPAI an anaconda environment can be used for installing all the 
required dependencies as following:

```bash
conda create -n spai python=3.11
conda activate spai
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.4 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Furthermore, the installation of [Nvidia APEX](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex) is required for training.  

### Weights Checkpoint

The trained weights checkpoint can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vvXmZqs6TVJdj8iF1oJ4L_fcgdQrp_YI/view?usp=sharing) 
and should be placed under the `weights` directory, located under the project's root directory.

## :fire: Inference

To compute the predicted scores for a set of images, place them under a directory
and use the following command.

```bash
python -m spai infer --input <input_dir> --output <output_dir>
```

where:
- `input_dir`: is a directory where the input images are located,
- `output_dir`: is a directory where a csv file with the predictions will be written.

The `--input` option also accepts CSV files containing the paths of the images. The CSV
files of the evaluation set, included under the `data` directory, can be used as examples.
For downloading the images of these evaluation CSVs, check the instruction [here](docs/data.md).

## :triangular_ruler: Architecture Overview

<p align="center">
    <img src="docs/architecture.svg" alt="Overview of the SPAI architecture" />
</p>

We learn a model of the spectral distribution of real images under a self-supervised setup using
masked spectral learning. Then, we use the spectral reconstruction similarity to measure the divergence from this learned distribution and
detect AI-generated images as out-of-distribution samples of this model. Spectral context vector captures the spectral context under which
the spectral reconstruction similarity values are computed, while spectral context attention enables the processing of any-resolution images
for capturing subtle spectral inconsistencies.

## :muscle: Training

### Required pre-trained model
Download the pre-trained ViT-B/16 MFM model from its [public repo](https://github.com/Jiahao000/MFM)
and place it under the `weights` directory:
```txt
weights
|_ mfm_pretrain_vit_base.pth
```

### Required data
Latent diffusion training and validation data can be downloaded from their corresponding [repo](https://github.com/grip-unina/DMimageDetection).
Furthermore, the corresponding instructions for downloading COCO and LSUN should be followed. 
They should be placed under the `datasets` directory as following:
```txt
datasets
|_latent_diffusion_trainingset
  |_train
    ...
  |_val
    ...
|_COCO
  ...
|_LSUN
  ...
```

Then, a csv file describing these data should be created as following:

```bash
python spai/create_dmid_ldm_train_val_csv.py \
  --train_dir "./datasets/latent_diffusion_trainingset/train" \
  --val_dir "./datasets/latent_diffusion_trainingset/val" \
  --coco_dir "./datasets/COCO" \
  --lsun_dir "./datasets/LSUN" \
  -o "./datasets/ldm_train_val.csv"
```

The validation split can be augmented as following:

```bash
python spai/tools/augment_dataset.py \
  --cfg ./configs/vit_base/vit_base__multipatch__100ep__intermediate__restore__patch_proj_per_feature__last_proj_layer_no_activ__fre_orig_branch__all_layers__bce_loss__light_augmentations.yaml \
  -c ./datasets/ldm_val.csv \
  -o ./datasets/ldm_val_augm.csv \
  -d ./datasets/latent_diffusion_trainingset_augm
```

Then, training can be performed as following:

```bash
python -m spai train \
  --cfg "./configs/spai.yaml" \
  --batch-size 72 \
  --pretrained "./weights/mfm_pretrain_vit_base.pth" \
  --output "./output/train" \
  --data-path "./datasets/ldm_train_val.csv" \
  --tag "spai" \
  --amp-opt-level "O2" \
  --data-workers 8 \
  --save-all \
  --opt "DATA.VAL_BATCH_SIZE" "256" \
  --opt "MODEL.FEATURE_EXTRACTION_BATCH" "400" \
  --opt "DATA.TEST_PREFETCH_FACTOR" "1"
```

## :mag_right: Evaluation

When a model has been trained using the previous script, it can be evaluated as following:

```bash
python -m spai test \
  --cfg "./configs/spai.yaml" \
  --batch-size 8 \
  --model "./output/train/finetune/spai/<epoch_name>.pth" \
  --output "./output/spai/test" \
  --tag "spai" \
  --opt "MODEL.PATCH_VIT.MINIMUM_PATCHES" "4" \
  --opt "DATA.NUM_WORKERS" "8" \
  --opt "MODEL.FEATURE_EXTRACTION_BATCH" "400" \
  --opt "DATA.TEST_PREFETCH_FACTOR" "1" \
  --test-csv "<test_csv_path>"
```

where:
- `test_csv_path`: Path to a csv file including the paths of the testing data.
- `epoch_name`: Filename of the epoch selected during validation.
