user environment. 
We do not recommend users mixing those two environments unless absolutely
necessary. Note that

Remember that many packages have already been installed on the system and can
be loaded using 
the 'module load <package__name>' command. If you are uncertain if a package is
already available 
on the system, please use 'module avail' or 'module spider' to search for it.
